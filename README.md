# MeltiPolicyCache
This project is a high-performance, thread-safe in-memory cache system implemented in Modern C++. It supports multiple cache eviction strategies and is designed for high-concurrency scenarios by minimizing lock contention.

It is focus on the ArcCache which include LruCache and LfuCache. They can dynamic change the capacity of the lru and lfu.

This project is based on the youngyangyang04/KamaCache, thanks for the idea!
